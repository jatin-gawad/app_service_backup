# Azure SQL Database Backup and Recovery Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines the best practices and detailed steps for configuring backups and ensuring disaster recovery for Azure SQL Database.

---

## Backup Types

### 1. Automated Backups
- Azure SQL Database automatically performs:
  - **Full Backups**: Weekly.
  - **Differential Backups**: Every 12-24 hours.
  - **Transaction Log Backups**: Every 5-10 minutes.
- Retention Policy:
  - Point-in-Time Restore (PITR): Configurable from 7 to 35 days.
  - Long-Term Retention (LTR): Up to 10 years.

### 2. Manual Backups
- Create manual backups for critical operations:
  1. Use the `Export` feature to save a `.bacpac` file.
  2. Store the `.bacpac` file in Azure Blob Storage.

## Industry Best Practices

### 1. Point-in-Time Restore (PITR)
- Retention: Configure for **30 days** in production environments.
- Use cases: Recover from accidental deletions or corruption.

### 2. Differential Backups
- Frequency: Retain the default frequency of every 12-24 hours.
- Adjust for high transaction workloads if needed.

### 3. Long-Term Retention (LTR)
- Retention: Configure based on compliance requirements (e.g., 1 year, 5 years, or 10 years).
- Storage: Use Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS) for additional resilience.

### 4. Geo-Replication
- Enable geo-replication for high availability.
- Benefits: Ensures secondary replica is available in case of a regional outage.

### 5. Backup Testing
- Regularly test both PITR and LTR restores.
- Schedule quarterly restore drills.

### 6. Monitoring and Alerts
- Use Azure Monitor to:
  - Track backup job status.
  - Set alerts for failures.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Enabling and Configuring Backups
1. **Point-in-Time Restore**:
   - Navigate to the Azure Portal.
   - Select the SQL Database.
   - Go to **Settings > Backups**.
   - Configure the retention period under PITR settings.

2. **Long-Term Retention**:
   - Navigate to **Settings > Backups** in the Azure Portal.
   - Under LTR settings, configure:
     - Backup frequency: Weekly/Monthly/Yearly.
     - Retention period.
   - Save changes.

3. **Manual Backup**:
   - Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
   - Connect to the Azure SQL Database.
   - Right-click the database > Tasks > Export Data-tier Application.
   - Save the `.bacpac` file to Azure Blob Storage.

### Restoring a Database
1. **Point-in-Time Restore**:
   - Navigate to the SQL Database.
   - Select **Restore** from the toolbar.
   - Choose a timestamp within the retention period.
   - Confirm and monitor the restore process.

2. **Long-Term Retention Restore**:
   - Navigate to the LTR backups under **Manage Backups**.
   - Select the desired backup.
   - Click **Restore** and choose the target server.

## Recommendations
- Configure PITR retention for 30 days.
- Enable LTR for all production databases with retention of at least 1 year.
- Test restores every quarter to validate backups.
- Monitor backups with Azure Monitor and set up alerts.
- Document all recovery procedures in a runbook for quick reference during emergencies.
